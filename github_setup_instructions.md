# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

To upload your MNIST Neural Network project to GitHub, follow these steps:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" button in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter the repository name: `mnist-neural-network`
4. Add a description: "Neural network implementation for MNIST handwritten digit classification with backpropagation"
5. Choose "Public" visibility
6. Do not initialize the repository with any files (since you already have files locally)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to connect your existing repository. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/mnist-neural-network.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## 3. Verify Your Repository

1. Refresh the GitHub page to see your files uploaded
2. Make sure all these files are present:
   - README.md
   - mnist_classifier.py
   - mnist_report.md
   - requirements.txt
   - validation_accuracy.png
   - .gitignore

## 4. Future Updates

For future changes, use the standard Git workflow:

```bash
# Make changes to your files
# Then add changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```
